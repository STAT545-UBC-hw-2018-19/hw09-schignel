histv_dat <- read.delim("hist_vowels.tsv")
```

On most *nix systems, the file `/usr/share/dict/words` contains a bunch of words.On my machine, it contains `r sum(histv_dat$Freq)` words.

I computed the number of vowels in each word and tabulated how many words have 0 vowels, 1 vowel, 2 vowels, etc.

The most frequent number of vowels is `r with(histv_dat, Vowels[which.max(Freq)])`.
